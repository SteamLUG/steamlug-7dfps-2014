Bug hunt and update compat with latest godot

Switch (entirely?) to udp for networking
	Make networked movement smoother (increased update frequency, lerping)

Proper collision detection
	Networked death of humans

More reliable lantern hitting ghost detection (not a bunch of raycasts)

Networked reveal state of ghost
	Ghost slow when revealed

Make UI scale nicely

Art pass (currently, almost EVERYTHING is placeholder)

We decided on an MIT license, put notices in code

Add more to TODO

Bug hunt and update compat with latest godot

Switch (entirely?) to udp for networking
	Make networked movement smoother (increased update frequency, lerping)
	TCP (so not how we want it) but here is an interesting networked physics demo: https://github.com/jrimclean/network-demo-tcp

Proper collision detection
	Networked death of humans

More reliable lantern hitting ghost detection (not a bunch of raycasts)

Networked reveal state of ghost
	Ghost slow when revealed

Add goals for humans.
	End game screen and return to lobby when end conditions are met.

Make UI scale nicely

Art pass (currently, almost EVERYTHING is placeholder)

Scan for available maps to choose from instead of predefining, maybe with sharing of maps

Interface to choose who is the ghost (but first decide how)

Add more to TODO
